      <p>
         I am a senior at the University of Kentucky graduating May 2017 with a
         B.S. in Mathematics and Minor in Computer Science.
         <br/><br/>
         I am currently pursuing a job in the actuary field. I have passed exam P and am 
         going to take exam FM in April 2017. I am excited to start my career, meet
         fantastic people, and explore new places.
         <br/><br/>
         If you know anything about Myers-Briggs, I am a classic INTP. I strive to grow and learn 
         things in the field of my studies and passions on a daily basis. I don't want
         a day to go by without thinking critically about the things I am doing and 
         how I am living my life.
         <br/><br/>
         I am a man of efficiency. Whether it be getting homework done, studying for a test,
         or even simply trying to win a video game, I am always thinking of ways to
         improve what I am doing to produce better results.
        <br/><br/>
        In my free time, I enjoy video games and music. I grew up as a percussionist and originially 
        went to school for music. Despite having changed majors, I still absolutely love drumming and music
        and it will always mean so much to me. I enjoy playing PC gaming and love the recent growth
        of eSports.
